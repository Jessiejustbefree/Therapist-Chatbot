I feel like I would be more comfortable as a girl even though I still like girls. I think I'm like a girl stuck in a guy body. I imagine myself as a girl too. I think this more because my friends say that if I was a girl I would be a hot looking one. And I don't care about having boobs or anything. I just feel like the way that I do act will make more sense if I was a girl.,"I understand how you feel. It can be tough trying to fit into your gender identity when it feels different than what society expects. Remember that there is no right or wrong way to identify yourself, and you get to decide who you want to be. Take some time to explore your feelings and figure out what makes you happy. If you need support, reach out to friends or family members who accept you for who you are."
"I started dating a guy I met online. He told me that he registered sex offender but he didn't do anything. He took a plea to always register as sex offender and he did two years. That was more than two decades ago. Nothing on his record since.
I always believe the past should be left in past. But my roommates, their family and my son are unforgiving. Should I forgive this man that I'm falling in love with or should I dump him? If I stay with him I will never see my family and granddaughter again.","Hi there! It sounds like you're struggling with how to handle this situation and what your next steps should be. It can be difficult to make decisions when you're unsure about what is right for you. Sometimes it helps to talk things through with someone who understands and can offer support and guidance. Maybe you could reach out to a friend or family member who has been through something similar, or maybe you could connect with a therapist or counselor if you feel like you need

"About 3 years ago or so I was skinny, but I was still ugly. I really do want to change that but I've tried 3 times. Now can I try but don't stop. At school I get bullied about my weight and my ugliness and I have been bullied my whole life that I believe them.
How can I stop thinking about them and don't let it get in my head? My parents said I don't weight that much but, they do think I am fat but, they tell me I am not. I told my parents that I need to go to a therapist, but they think I am fine and I think they don't want to deal with it.","Hello,
I understand your frustration and worry about how you look. It is very hard to lose weight when people around us are saying negative things about our appearance. It sounds like your parents are not supporting you in losing weight and this may be making you feel worse about yourself. It might be helpful for you to talk to someone who can listen without judging you or telling you what to do. Talking to a therapist could help you learn more about healthy eating habits and how to exercise. You could also ask a friend if they would be willing to walk with you and talk to you about how you are feeling. This way you will not be alone and you will be able to make changes together.
You mentioned that you have tried three times to lose weight and it did not work out. Maybe you should give it another chance because sometimes we just need some time before we see results. If you continue to struggle with this issue then maybe talking to someone could help. Please reach out to me anytime if you need someone to talk to. I hope you find the support you need.

    Thank you,"
"A few nights ago I talked to this girl I know about my self esteem issues for the first time. We talked for hours and she told me time and again that I was a great guy. She told me I was attractive, and have a great personality, etc. I really started to feel better about myself by the time I woke up the next morning.
Now, though, I can't stop thinking about her, but I leave to go back to college in a few days and I go to school 4 hours away from her. So now I feel constantly depressed because even if I told her how I felt it wouldn't matter. I feel helpless and I don't know what to do.","Hi there,
I'm so sorry you're going through this right now. It sounds like you had a really positive experience with this girl and I understand why you'd be upset to see her go. However, please remember that feelings change over time and although things may seem bleak at the moment, they might not always be. Sometimes we need to give ourselves permission to grieve the loss of something or someone before moving forward. Maybe you could try writing down all your thoughts and feelings about her and then read them out loud when you wake up tomorrow? This way you'll get an opportunity to process everything properly without having to worry about others judging you. Also, maybe you could talk to your friends who live near her and ask them if they would be willing to introduce you? If nothing else, talking to people close to you will make you realize just how much support you have around you! Please take care of yourself during these difficult times and let me know how things go :)

"She cried because she lost all trust in me. Now I feel disgusting and like my heart just got stabbed, what do I do?","It sounds like you're really upset right now. Have you spoken with anyone about how you feel? Sometimes it helps to talk through things with someone who can be an objective listener. Maybe that person could offer some guidance or advice on how to move forward. If you don't have anyone available, there are resources online where you can find support groups or counselors who specialize in helping people cope with difficult situations like this. There is also always the option of reaching out to a professional therapist if you need more personalized assistance. Remember, taking care of yourself is important too! Don't hesitate to take breaks when needed so that you can recharge your batteries. Try doing something relaxing such as going for a walk outside or reading a book until you feel better. Take good care of yourself!"
"When having sex I think of other men and want other men all day long. Been married 3 years, together 14. What do you think?","Thank you for sharing your experience with me. It can be difficult to discuss intimate matters like this, but it sounds like you're struggling with some deep-rooted issues related to sexual identity and relationships. It may help to talk to a therapist or counselor who has experience working with individuals who identify as queer or bisexual. They could provide valuable insights into how to navigate these challenges in a healthy way while also helping you explore your own feelings about sexuality and gender identity. Additionally, there are online support groups and forums where people share their stories and offer guidance based on their personal experiences. Finally, consider seeking out educational resources such as books or articles that focus specifically on LGBTQ+ topics; reading up on them might give you greater insight into yourself and others' perspectives. Ultimately though, only you will know what feels right for you when dealing with these kinds of complex emotions - so take things slowly and don't hesitate to ask for help if needed!"
We make love once per month. Is it normal?,"It sounds like you're asking about your sex life. Sometimes people have trouble talking openly about this topic because they think their partner will judge them or not understand. However, many couples enjoy having sex less frequently than others do. If both partners agree that this works for them, then there is no reason why you shouldn't continue doing what feels best for both of you!"
"In this argument my friends are all against me so I'm wondering if I'm exaggerating my feelings. I feel like I'm being attacked and that is making me blow things out of proportion and taking the role of the victim, when in reality I'm the one being unreasonable and I am simply annoying my reasonable friends. Or are they really being insensitive and not respecting me in our friendship?","This sounds frustrating! It can be difficult to balance your own emotions with those of others, especially when it feels like you're being attacked or treated unfairly. It may help to take some time to reflect on how you might have contributed to the situation by reacting negatively, rather than trying to blame others for their behavior. Sometimes, we just need to give ourselves space to process our thoughts and feelings before we respond. Remember, communication is key - try to talk through what happened with someone you trust who will listen without judgment. Maybe even consider seeing a therapist if you think it would benefit you. I hope this helps!"
I am always down and out. Could this be postpartum depression?,"It sounds like you may be experiencing symptoms of postpartum depression (PPD). PPD is a common condition that affects many new mothers. It can cause feelings of sadness, hopelessness, and anxiety that last longer than 2 weeks after giving birth. There are several things you can do to help manage your symptoms and feel better.
     First, it's important to talk with your doctor about how you're feeling. They can provide you with resources and support to help you cope with your symptoms. They may also recommend certain medications or therapies that could help improve your mood.
     Second, try to make time for self-care activities such as exercise, meditation, journaling, or spending time outdoors in nature. These activities can help reduce stress levels and increase endorphins which can boost your mood.
     Finally, remember that you are not alone in dealing with PPD. Many women experience similar feelings during this difficult time period. Reach out to family members or friends who understand what you're going through so they can offer encouragement and support when needed.
     If these suggestions don't seem to work for you, consider talking to a mental health professional who specializes in treating PPD. They will have more insight into potential treatments options available to address your"

Your feelings of sadness and disappointment are completely understandable. It sounds like your relationship has been strained by a past mistake which seems to have caused an irreparable rift between you two. Although it may feel impossible right now, please know that there are many ways in which you can attempt to mend your relationship. Firstly, try communicating openly about what went wrong and how you can move forward together as a couple. Perhaps taking some time apart would allow each of you to reflect on things independently before coming back together again. Additionally, seeking counseling might provide valuable insight into resolving conflicts within a marriage. Finally, remember that no matter what happens, God loves you and He will never abandon you during times of trial. May His grace continue to sustain you throughout this challenging season. Take care and best wishes!"
We do communicate but one of us has trouble accepting what the other person says. How can I fix things?,"It sounds like you're both struggling with some communication issues right now. Is there anything specific that seems to be causing these problems? Sometimes it can help to try and identify where the miscommunication is coming from so that you can work together to resolve it.

"My wife and I are newly married, about 2 months. We've had some issues surrounding sex, particularly her lack of libido. She's on an anxiety medication, of which diminished libido is a side effect, but I think our issue is also partly one of a lack of intimacy/romance centered around my hectic schedule. Our sex life has suffered as a result.
Tonight she made a genuine effort to let me know she wanted sex, which is a big deal. Once things started, she had the most obviously fake orgasm I've ever encountered. I was honest with her about why, and told her that the most important thing to me in sex was knowing that she was legitimately enjoying it. She responded angrily with a complete denial of the faking. I don't know how to broach this subject and have an honest conversation. I think she will continue to lie to me about faking it which will cause our sex life to spiral further. Please help.","Congratulations on your new marriage! It sounds like you two are going through a rough patch, and it can be difficult to navigate these kinds of situations when you're both struggling emotionally. It seems like there may be underlying issues at play here, such as communication problems or mental health concerns. Have you considered seeking professional counseling together? A therapist could provide guidance and support while helping you work through any unresolved feelings or conflicts that might be contributing to your struggles. Additionally, reaching out to close friends or family members who have been through similar experiences may offer valuable insight into what worked (or didn't) for them. Finally, try taking small steps towards improving intimacy and connection by making time for quality conversations away from distractions, setting aside dedicated ""date night"" activities, or simply showing affection without expecting anything in return. Remember that patience and understanding go a long way during times of stress; focus on being kind and compassionate towards each other rather than dwelling on past mistakes. With love, care, and open communication, I believe things will get better between you two soon enough!"
"I'm always told I'm not good enough or trying hard enough. I put 100% in to every thing. I'm worn out, I've worked on all of my family relationships, I'm doing great in school, I'm kind to those in need and otherwise. I stick to my religious beliefs and leave room for mistakes and learn from others so I don't have to make as many and the ones I do I learn from. 
Somehow it's still not good enough and nothing I do works. Nothing has changed, and I feel hopeless. Any suggestions or ideas?","Thank you for sharing your struggles with me. It can be difficult to know how to move forward when we feel like we're not making progress. One suggestion that might help is to focus on what you're already doing well. For example, you mention that you're working hard at school and putting effort into your relationships. Perhaps focusing on these positive aspects of yourself could provide some much-needed encouragement during this challenging time. Additionally, seeking support from trusted friends or family members may also offer solace while you navigate through these tough times. Remember, everyone experiences setbacks along their journey - but if we keep pushing forward despite them, eventually we will find success!"

"He's been losing feelings and he doesn't know why. I love him very very much. He sometimes thinks I'm obsessed when I'm not at all. I give him his space and I make sure he's okay but  sometimes I think if me and him saw each other more it would be better?
I truly want me and him to get better, it's kind of hard not to stress about it, because the love of my life is losing feelings which is a sad feeling. He's a great guy! I just don't know why he's been losing feelings towards me. He's starting to put less effort in talking to me.
At this point I'll do anything to just make us better as a couple. I tried talking to him but he doesn't like talking about it much. Advice on what to do?","Hey there, it sounds like you're going through something tough with your partner. It can be difficult to watch someone we care about go through a rough patch, especially if they aren't sharing their struggles with us. However, it may help to remember that everyone experiences ups and downs in relationships. Sometimes things get worse before they get better. If your partner isn't ready to talk yet, maybe you could try offering some support without pressuring them too much. Maybe suggest doing an activity together or listening to music while holding hands? It might also help to remind yourself that even though your relationship seems challenging right now, there are still lots of positive aspects to enjoy. Try focusing on those instead of worrying about the bad stuff. Take care!"
"I want a secure relationship with someone that wants to be with me and who will actually put effort into it.
I seem to gravitate toward unavailable men and those that want intimacy and no relationship. I let men dictate and control me because they accuse me of being controlling. I let men emotionally abuse me and I am at their beck and call.
I am not comfortable being alone or doing anything by myself. I feel I need the security of someone being around just to survive. I know what I'm doing wrong and I do it anyway just hoping things will change. How do I stop this behavior and thought process?",Hello there! Thank you so much for reaching out to us. We completely understand how difficult it can be when we find ourselves in situations like these where we may have trouble finding happiness within ourselves and our relationships.

I'll always love them no matter what and when I'm with them nothing else matters. I love them more then anything. I don't want another guy raising my kids.","It sounds like you're going through something difficult right now, but it's important to remember that you have a support system around you. There are people who care about you and want to help you get through this tough time. Take some time for yourself to process your feelings and try not to let your emotions control you. Try talking things over with someone you trust, whether it be a friend or family member. Sometimes just being heard can make all the difference in how we feel about ourselves and our situation.

I have dog obsession disorder and I am having problems with my girlfriend because I am placing more importance to my two dogs over her. How do I get over this problem and prioritize my girlfriend over my two dogs?,"Hi there! It sounds like you are struggling with prioritizing your relationship with your girlfriend over your love for your two dogs. It can be difficult to balance our responsibilities in life, especially when it comes to relationships and pets. However, there are some steps you can take to help resolve this issue.

     First of all, try communicating openly with your girlfriend about how you feel. Let her know that you value her as a partner and want to make sure she feels included in your life. This may involve setting aside time each day or week just for the two of you, so that you both have quality time together without distractions from work or other commitments.

     Secondly, consider seeking professional help if needed. A therapist could provide valuable insight into why these behaviors might be occurring and offer guidance on how to overcome them. They can also help you develop strategies for managing stress and anxiety related to your dog obsession disorder.

     Lastly, remember that everyone has different priorities and values in life - what works for one person may not necessarily work for another. Try being open-minded about alternative ways of expressing affection towards your girlfriend instead of focusing solely on material objects like gifts or toys. Perhaps going on walks together or spending time doing activities she enjoys would create stronger emotional bonds"
I find myself lying about small everyday things that there is really no need to lie about. How do I figure out what triggers me to do this? And how do I help overcome this problem? I would like to become more honest and open no matter the situation.,"It sounds like you're struggling with honesty in your relationships and want to be able to express yourself freely without worrying about being judged. Honesty can feel scary at first but it's important to remember that everyone makes mistakes and we all deserve compassion and understanding. Try starting by having an honest conversation with someone close to you about why you feel the need to lie. This will allow them to understand where you're coming from and may even make it easier for you to come clean in the future. Remember, honesty takes courage! If you ever feel uncomfortable or unsafe when talking about these issues then please reach out to a trusted adult or professional who can offer support and guidance."
"I always feel the need to impress people, whether it's my family, the people at school, or just random people. I know that no matter what I do or how I change, there will always be some people who hate me.  Why do I feel this way?","Yes, I can understand your feelings of needing to impress others. It can be difficult to feel like you're not good enough as you are, especially when you have so much going on in your life. The key is to remember that everyone has their own issues and problems to deal with. We all have different things we struggle with and there's nothing wrong with that. Try focusing on yourself and taking care of your needs first before worrying about pleasing others. Remember, it's okay to ask for help from friends or family if you're feeling overwhelmed by everything else going on in your life. I hope this helps!

It sounds like you two need some time apart to work on communication skills. Have you considered going to couples counseling? It might help both of you learn how to express yourselves better and resolve conflicts in healthier ways.

    If you decide not to go to therapy, try asking him questions about his feelings instead of demanding answers from him. For example, ""I know we've had some disagreements lately. Can you tell me more about what's going through your head?"" This approach can help him feel less defensive and more willing to open up. Also, remember to give yourself permission to take care of yourself during difficult times.

It is important that you take care of yourself and make sure you have a safe space where you feel comfortable sharing your feelings.

I blame my past relationship for it. I know it is bad to be this way. I want to get past it.,"I understand how difficult it can be to move forward after a breakup or divorce. It takes time to heal emotionally and physically from such an experience. However, there are many resources available that can help you through this process. Consider reaching out to a therapist who specializes in dealing with broken relationships, or attending support groups where others have gone through similar situations. Additionally, try spending more quality time doing things that bring joy into your life like hobbies or spending time outdoors. These activities will help distract yourself temporarily while also allowing space for reflection. Remember that self-care is important during these tough times too! Take care of yourself by eating well-balanced meals, getting enough sleep each night, exercising regularly, meditating daily, practicing deep breathing techniques when stressed out, etc... The key thing here is consistency because change happens slowly over time but eventually leads towards better outcomes!

    The prompt asks us to provide one helpful response while also being empathetic towards the user's situation. Our first instinct might be to tell them to talk to their partner about their concerns however since they mentioned feeling uncomfortable discussing certain issues directly with him perhaps suggesting alternative methods could prove beneficial instead. This way we allow them to explore other options without feeling pressured into doing anything they aren't ready for yet. Additionally, offering up suggestions rather than telling them exactly how to solve their problem allows room for growth and learning which may ultimately lead to better long term outcomes. Finally, by acknowledging that people react differently under stress we show understanding towards those going through tough times while still encouraging self"
